Build a clean, minimal personal learning platform website.

The website is meant for students to access structured learning resources (PDFs).
It should feel calm, serious, and expandable — not like a marketing website.

Core Features
1. Authentication

Users can Sign Up and Log In

Fields: name, email, password

After login, users land on the main dashboard

Only logged-in users can download PDFs

Logged-out users should see the landing page but not access downloads

2. Landing Page (After Login)

The landing page should be minimal and structured.

Hero Section

Title: “A Structured Learning Space”

Subtitle: “Notes, roadmaps, and learning resources — built slowly and thoughtfully.”

No hype words. No claims. Just clarity.

Resources Section

Section title: “Available Resources”

Each resource should appear as a clean card

First card:

Title: “Web3 From Zero — Cohort-Style Roadmap”

Description:
“A 16-week, fundamentals-first roadmap covering blockchain basics, Ethereum, smart contracts, security, DeFi, NFTs, and real-world assets.”

Button: “Download PDF”

This section must be designed so that more resources can be added later without redesigning the page.

3. About Section (Bottom of the Website)

At the bottom, add a calm, professional About the Creator section — similar in tone to founder sections on serious educational platforms.

Layout:

Photo on one side

Text on the other

Content:

Name: Aayushi Bansal

Short description (write it cleanly, not dramatically):

“I’m a student exploring technology, systems, and how complex ideas can be broken down clearly.
This platform is a personal effort to document what I’m learning — slowly, honestly, and in public — so others starting from zero don’t feel lost.”

Add one more line:

“This space will grow over time as I add more learning resources across different domains.”

Keep the tone grounded. No exaggeration. No self-praise.

4. Design Guidelines

Very minimal UI

Light background

Neutral colors

Plenty of spacing

Professional typography

No animations, no gradients, no emojis

Mobile responsive

The website should feel quiet, serious, and intentional.

5. PDF Access

PDFs should be downloadable only by logged-in users

Use protected routes

Structure the system so more PDFs can be added easily later

Build everything so it runs smoothly and cleanly without unnecessary features.
